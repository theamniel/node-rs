/// A module for working with paths.
///
/// This module provides functionalities for handling and manipulating paths in a program.
/// It is designed to be used for any path-related operations, making it easier to work with
/// file system paths, URLs, or any other types of paths in a generic way.
///
/// # Example
///
/// To use this module, simply import it and utilize its functions or types as needed:
///
/// ```rust
/// use common::path;
///
/// fn main() {
///     // Example usage of a function or type from this module
///     // let result = path::some_function("example/path");
///     // assert_eq!(result, "expected_result");
/// }
/// ```
